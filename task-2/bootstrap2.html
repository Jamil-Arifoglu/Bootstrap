                        developed nationally and specifically by Baykar, will guide the combat concept of the future.

                        The combat unmanned aircraft system, developed by Baykar and based on the experience of
                        Bayraktar UAVs/SİHAs, which changed the game in the world, will serve by being equipped with the
                        technologies of the future.

                        Bayraktar KIZILELMA (MIUS), which can perform air-to-air combat with aggressive maneuvers, will
                        be a power multiplier for the security forces with its low radar cross section. Bayraktar
                        KIZILELMA (MIUS), which will have the ability to take off and land from ships with short

                        Longer and wider than the Bayraktar TB2, the Akıncı UAV will have a 20-meter wingspan with its
                        unique twisted wing structure and will be able to carry a large number of national smart
                        ammunition. Akıncı will also be smarter and more aware of environmental conditions, thanks to
                        its unique artificial intelligence system, and will offer advanced flight and diagnostic
                        functions to its users.

                        Like Bayraktar TB2, Akıncı, which aims to be a leader in its class, will also perform some of
                        the tasks performed by warplanes. The electronic support pod it carries will serve with much
                        more advanced payloads such as satellite communication systems, air-to-air radars, obstacle
                        detection radar, synthetic aperture radar. With Akıncı, which will reduce the burden of
                        warplanes, aerial bombardment can also be carried out. Akıncı UAV, which will be equipped with
                        air-to-air missiles developed nationally in our country, can also be used in air-air missions.

                        Bayraktar Akıncı Attack Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System, which has been worked on to become the
                        most advanced technological system in the world in its class, has been produced locally and
                        nationally as MAM-L, MAM-C, Cirit, L-UMTAS, Bozok, MK-81, MK-82, MK- 83 will be equipped with

                        Bayraktar TB2 Tactical Armed Unmanned Aerial Vehicle is an unmanned aerial vehicle in the medium altitude-long stay-in-air class (MALE) for reconnaissance and intelligence missions. It has fully autonomous taxi, takeoff, landing and normal navigation capabilities with its triple redundant avionics systems and sensor fusion architecture. The TB2, which has flown more than 500,000 hours, has been actively serving since 2014 within the Turkish Armed Forces, Gendarmerie and Police Department. Currently, hundreds of Bayraktar TB2 S/UAV Platforms are working in the inventory of Turkey, Qatar, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and delivery countries. Bayraktar TB2 broke the record for airtime (27 Hours and 3 Minutes) and altitude (25,30 feet) in Turkish aviation history. Bayraktar TB2 is also the first aircraft exported in this scale. <span class="
